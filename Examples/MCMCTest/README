Problem:

read the simulator.c file.

The simulator output the discrepancy
between simulation and data (not squared).
MCMC geneates Gaussian given standard deviation
as likelihood function.
The program adds some noise to it.

To use:
- cc -c simulator simulator.c -lm
- psuade psuadeRS.in
- mv psuadeData psData
- psuade
> load psData
> rsmcmc
...
enter: mcmcFile
> quit

Use matlab to view matlabmcmc.m and matlabmcmc2.m

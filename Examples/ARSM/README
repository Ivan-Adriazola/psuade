This example demonstrates adaptive response surface analysis:

=============================================================
To run it:
(1) cc -o simulator simulator.c -lm
(2) psuade psuadeARSM1.in
    <answer 'n' to random selection or not>
    <answer 'n' to whether a test set is available>

=============================================================
If you would like to generate a test set, do:

psuade psuadeValidate.in

and then rename psuadeData (to another name such as psValid)
and then when you run adaptive sampling, answer 'y' to whether
    a test set is available.

=============================================================
When the runs are then, you can look at the locations of the
sample points by:

- rename psuadeData to, for example, psD
- psuade
  > load psD
  > iplot2
    <select input 1 to be the X axis>

- use matlab to view matlabiplt2.m

=============================================================
You can also visualize the response surface by
- psuade
  > load psD
  > rs2
    < use MARS with bootstrapping>
    < do not set lower or upper bound>

- use matlab to view matlabrs2.m

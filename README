Installing PSUADE libraries

A. To install the PSUADE package, go to the PSUADE directory and issue
   an "install_psuade" command with one of the following arguments.
    - LINUX (for PC with Linux O.S.)
    - IRIX (for SGI IRIX machines)
    - SUN4, SUN5, HPUX, ALPHA, IRIX64 for others
    - Or, use your favorite compiler in mh-user, and choose USER

   You may also issue the command without an argument. In this case 
   you will choose the platform on which you wish to run from the 
   "install_psuade" menu that will appear after entering the 
   "install_psuade" command.

   After exiting "install_psuade", issue a "make" from inside the PSUADE
   directory to make all libraries (the library files are located in 
   the Src/Lib/<arch> directory)

B. After all compilation is done successfully, the executable "psuade"
   can be found in the bin directory.

C. Now read the short manual in the Doc/Manual directory and follow the 
   instructions to get a simple application running within minutes.
